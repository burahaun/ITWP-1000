      <p class="par1">Using virtual filters on our faces when taking pictures and using face ID for unlocking our phones are two examples of artificial intelligence that are now part of our daily lives. The former incorporates face detection, meaning any human face is identified. The latter uses face recognition through which a specific face is recognized. Facial recognition is also used for surveillance and security by government facilities and at airports.</p>

        <p>In this video, we get a brief overview on machine learning, what it is, and how it works. A lot of information is given so be sure to watch a longer video if you want to learn.</p>

        <h3>Where will AI be in 50 Years?</h3>
        <p class="hobbie-par">There has been no better time to be in the world of artificial intelligence than now. AI has achieved an inflection point and is poised to transform every industry. Much has already been written about specific applications of AI. In the next 10 years, AI may be at the point where many of the jobs we know today which are worked by humans, will be automated by AI. For example, fast food workers and retail workers can be replaced by AI in the foreseeable future.</p>
