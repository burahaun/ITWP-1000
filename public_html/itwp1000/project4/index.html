									<h2>Our chatroom philosophy</h2>

									<p>Are you struggling with a composition or do you have a technical question about photography and don't know where to turn? Chat us up here at The Photobooth This is a friendly space to ask for help or get advice about photography from other fans like yourself! The Photobooth users represent a wide variety of experience levels from beginners to novices and all the way up to professionals who have been in the business for a long time. It is almost a certainty that someone at The Photobooth can help solve your problem or give you advice that will put you on the path to solving it yourself! I love taking pictures of my dogs. Unfortunately for all of you that also means I love POSTING pictures of my dogs to this website. So, you may wonder if I can ever run out of my seemingly endless enthusiasm for photographing felines, and I can humbly assure you that the answer is in the negative. I read an article about this couple that lived in a Frank Lloyd Wright house that had a stunning view of the outside, but it also had these windows embedded in the ceiling and the exterior wall that created these beautiful patterns on the floor. Almost every month they would snap pictures of these patterns as they changed with the seasons and the weather. They finally realized they were basically taking the same pictures every year, but, remarkably, the feeling the patterns evoked was new every time. That is the same feeling I have with taking pictures of my cats. So, if you tire of my cat photos for anyone else's photos) that is OK, but let us each enjoy posting what gives us joy.
