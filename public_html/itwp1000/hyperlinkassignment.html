<h2>7 Stanzas</h2>

<i>by Eman D</i>
<br>
  <p>
  <a id="t1"></a>Because of you, I cant say "I Love You" anymore. <br>
  My heart was locked but some how you opened the door. <br>
  No ones ever made me feel the way you have. <br>
  Things will never be the same, nothing can replace what we had.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a id="t2"></a>We joked all the time, laughed endlessly. <br>
  Your an angel and I fell in love helplessly. <br>
  Sometimes you'd cry but I was sure to be there.<br>
  Nothing less of beautiful, sometimes all I could do was stare.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a id="t3"></a>Your smile, I loved your smile.<br>
  Your steeze, no one came close to your style.<br>
  Gorgeous and beautiful, not "sexy" or "fine".<br>
  A heart so generous enough to warm mine.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a id="t4"></a>Things are a mess, I was being selfish. <br>
  You were everything I wanted, my every wish.<br>
  I had to let you go, but I regret it every single day.<br>
  If I knew things would be like this, I would've stayed.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a id="t5"></a>Now, I'm scared to say "I Love You" to anyone else,<br>
  because your love was the purest feeling I've ever felt.<br>
  I don't wanna hear "I Love You" from no one other than you.<br>
  Our love is lost, theres nothing we can do.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a id="t6"></a>Every night, tears slide down my blank face.<br>
  My body so cold, just wanting you to embrace.<br>
  I lie on my bed, w/ feelings of 1,000 pounds on my chest.<br>
  Waking from my dreams of you, never can I rest.
  </p>

  <p>
  <a id="t7"></a>7 stanzas aren't even a fraction of what I want to say. <br>
  There will never be a night or day, where I will truly be OK. <br>
  Say it once more, say it for me just one more time.<br>
  "I Love You" from you lips is all I wanna hear before I die.
