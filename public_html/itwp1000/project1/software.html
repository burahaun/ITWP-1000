      <h2 class="headerSE">How Do You Become A Software Engineer?</h2>
      <p class="par1">Typically, the way to become a software engineer is by going to a college or university, and studying Computer Science, this is the most common way. Students of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering often go on to work as software engineers too. Even students with just a minor in Computer Science can work as software engineers. It's also common for people with unrelated degrees or bootcamp degrees to also work as software engineers. And these days, many people also enter the field being completely self taught.</p>
